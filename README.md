## Employee Attrition Prediction Project
### 📌 Overview

This project analyzes employee attrition data to identify key factors contributing to employee turnover and builds predictive models to forecast attrition risk. The analysis provides actionable insights for HR departments to improve retention strategies.

### 🔍 Key Features
Comprehensive EDA: Detailed exploratory analysis of 31 employee attributes

Multiple ML Models: Random Forest, XGBoost, Logistic Regression, SVM, Neural Networks

Hyperparameter Tuning: GridSearchCV and BayesSearchCV for optimal model performance

Feature Importance: Identifies top factors driving employee attrition

Actionable Insights: Data-driven recommendations for reducing turnover

### 📊 Key Findings
Employees working overtime are 2.3x more likely to leave

Low job satisfaction increases attrition risk by 68%

Employees with >10 mile commutes show 40% higher attrition

Sales department has highest attrition rates (28% vs company average 16%)

### 🛠 Technical Implementation
Python data science stack (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn)

Advanced feature engineering and preprocessing

Class imbalance handling techniques

Model evaluation with precision, recall, and F1-score

TensorFlow implementation for deep learning approach

### 💡 Business Value
